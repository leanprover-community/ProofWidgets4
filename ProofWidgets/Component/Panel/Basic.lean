/-- In the infoview, an **info block** is a top-level collapsible block corresponding to a given
location in a Lean file (e.g. with the header `▼ Basic.lean:12:34`).

A **panel widget** is a component which can appear as a panel inside an info block in the infoview.
For example, a tactic state display.
The type `PanelWidgetProps` represents the props passed to a panel widget.
The TypeScript version is exported as `PanelWidgetProps` from `@leanprover/infoview`.

Note that to be a good citizen which doesn't mess up the infoview layout,
a panel widget should be a block element,
and should provide some way to collapse it,
for example by using `<details>` as the top-level tag. -/
structure PanelWidgetProps : Type where
  /-- Cursor position in the file at which the widget is being displayed. -/
  pos : Lsp.Position
  /-- The current tactic-mode goals. -/
  goals : Array Widget.InteractiveGoal
  /-- The current term-mode goal, if any. -/
  termGoal? : Option Widget.InteractiveTermGoal
  /-- Locations currently selected in the goal state. -/

/-- Display the selected panel widgets in the nested tactic script. For example,
assuming we have written a `GeometryDisplay` component,
```lean
by with_panel_widgets [GeometryDisplay]
  simp
  rfl
```
will show the geometry display alongside the usual tactic state throughout the proof.
