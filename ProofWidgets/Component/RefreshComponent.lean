# The `RefreshComponent` widget

This file defines `RefreshComponent`, which allows you to have an HTML widget that updates
incrementally as more results are computed by a Lean computation.

## Known limitations

Cancellation is a bit hard to get right, and there is one limitation.

1. When using a `RefreshComponent` that comes directly from a command/tactic (no shift-clicking),
then we pass the cancel token used by elaboration to the refresh component computation.
Unfortunately there is an edge case where the cancel token gets set while the corresponding
command does not get re-elaborated. In particular, if you have three command in a row, e.g.
```
#html countToTen
#html countToTen
#html countToTen
```
Then commenting out the third command will cancel the widget of the first command.
It refreshes the second command, and doesn't affect commands before the first command - only
the first command gets badly affected.

/-- A HTML tree together with a version number.
We use this to check whether the tree currently on display is up to date. -/
structure VersionedHtml where
  html : Html
  idx : Nat
  deriving RpcEncodable

/-- The server-side state of a `RefreshComponent`. -/
structure RefreshState where
  /-- The HTML tree to display, stored as a delayed computation.

  We only force the thunk when the client requests it.
  This means that if several updates arrive in quick succession,
  only the ones that the client actually sees will be computed. -/
  curr : Thunk Html
  /-- Version of the current HTML tree.
  It should increase by `1` with each state update. -/
  idx : Nat
  /-- A task that resolves when this state has become out-of-date.
  It resolves with `some ()` if a new state is available,
  and with `none` if the display will never be updated again.

  It is implemented using `RefreshToken.promise.result?`,
  but we don't store the `Promise` here
  in order to make sure it can reach a refcount of 0. -/
  next : Task (Option Unit)
  deriving Inhabited

/-- A reference to a `RefreshState`.
Only exists because `TypeName` is not derivable for compound types. -/

  ref : IO.Ref RefreshState

/-- The data used to call `awaitRefresh`, for updating the HTML display. -/

/-- If any updates are available (i.e., the server-side state is more recent than the client's),
immediately return the most recent version of the HTML tree.
Otherwise await the next update.
Returns `none` if the client's state is the last one that should be shown. -/

/-- HACK: We cancel background threads driving `RefreshComponent`s when they are no longer needed.
However, there is currently no good way to do this when the infoview closes,
as in that case React effect cleanup functions are never executed.
Instead, `RefreshComponent` calls this persistent monitor task during creation.
The call is auto-cancelled when the infoview closes, setting `cancelTk`. -/

/-- Displays a HTML tree, refreshing the display when the tree is updated.

Use `mkRefreshComponentM` to conveniently spawn a dedicated thread
from which you can update the display.

The component resets its state when rendered with a new `props.state`.
Conversely, reusing `props.state` preserves the client-side state.  -/

/-! ## API for creating a `RefreshComponent` -/

/-- A `RefreshToken` allows you to manage a `RefreshComponent` instance.

Use `RefreshToken.update` to update the HTML currently on display.
Use `RefreshToken.cancelTk` to check if the instance has been discarded. -/
structure RefreshToken where
  state : IO.Ref RefreshState
  /-- If set, the `RefreshComponent` is no longer displayed in the UI.
  The `RefreshToken` should be discarded, and any associated thread should exit. -/
  cancelTk : IO.CancelToken
  /-- The promise that `RefreshState.next` waits for.

  If we drop the `RefreshToken`, and hence this promise,
  `RefreshState.next` will resolve to `none`.
  This ensures that no `awaitRefresh` call is left hanging forever
  when all threads holding onto this `RefreshToken` have exited. -/
  private promise : IO.Ref (IO.Promise Unit)

/-- Create a `RefreshToken` with an initial HTML tree. -/
private def RefreshToken.new (initial : Thunk Html) : BaseIO RefreshToken := do
  let promise ← IO.Promise.new

    promise := ← IO.mkRef promise
  }

/-- Update the current HTML tree to be `html`.

The `html` thunk is only forced when the client requests it;
if another update is made before that, it will never be forced.

This function is thread-safe: each update is made atomically. -/
