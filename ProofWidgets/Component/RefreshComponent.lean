## The `RefreshComponent` widget

This file defines `RefreshComponent`, which allows you to have an HTML widget that updates
incrementally as more results are computed by a Lean computation.

For this interaction, we use an `IO.Ref` that the JavaScript reads from.
It stores the HTML that should currently be on display, and a task returning the next HTML.
To determine whether the widget is up to date, each computed HTML has an associated version number.
(So, the `n`-th HTML will have index `n`)

When the widget (re)loads, it first loads the current HTML from the ref, and then
repeatedly awaits further HTML result.
