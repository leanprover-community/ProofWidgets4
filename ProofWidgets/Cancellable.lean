/-! Experimental support for cancellable RPC requests.

Note: Cancellation should eventually become a feature of the core RPC protocol,
and the requests map should be stored in `RequestM`,
or somewhere in the server anyway. -/

Throws an error if the `rid` is invalid,

another possible addition to the RPC protocol? -/
